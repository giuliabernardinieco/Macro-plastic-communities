# Macro-plastic Pollution in the Thames

This code is associated to my dissertation project.
The original data are owned by the organisation I worked with and cannot be published here. To run the code a fake datset "dummy-data.csv" was generated, but the code is built on the original dataset. 
The results and output produced by running plastic-code.R with dummy-data.csv are not the ones reported in my dissertation project. Some comments and tests only make sense with the original dataset.

# Instruction on how to run the code

Download plastic-code.R and the dummy-data.csv with the green button "clone or download". Place them in the same working directory on your PC.
In the plastic-code.R, on line 7, set your working directory with the folder where you have stored dummy-data.csv and plastic-code.R

plastic-code.R is divided in sections and it is commented throughout
